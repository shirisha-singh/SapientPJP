#JavaProgram

ReturnSynonyms.java would have a dictionary comprising of certain words and their corresponding synonyms.

1. If a user enters a word already present in the dictionary, all the synonyms would be displayed.
2. If the word does not exist in the dictionary, the user would be asked if he/she wants it to be added, if yes then the user would be prompted for synonyms of the word until he/she enters a black line and the dictionary would be updated.
3. If no, the program would exit.
